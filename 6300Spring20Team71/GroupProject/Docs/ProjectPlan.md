# Project Plan

**Author**: \<Team71\>

### 1 Introduction

This project is a word based game developed for the android platform. The main goal of the game is for the player to create as many words from a given set of alphabets within a fixed time and points are scored for each letter in the word.

### 2 Process Description

#### a. Activity Name:
Individual - Project Immersion, Requirements Gathering and Design

#### Activity description:
This is the phase where we each went over the given problem statement i.e. the project description. We understood the scope of the project, what it intends and what the limitations and risks are and created a UML diagram for it.

#### Entrance criteria:
Project description.

#### Exit criteria:
A thorough understanding of the task at hand and a UML diagram showing how we each intent on executing the project.

#### b.	Activity Name:
Group - Project Immersion and Brainstorm

#### Activity description:
In this phase, we met as a group for the first time and essentially redid what we had done individually, albeit at a much deeper level. We went over the project requirements as a group, evaluated each other's UML diagram and critiqued it highlighting pros and cons. At this stage we did not yet create a team UML but simply understood each other’s thought processes and ideas.

#### Entrance criteria:
Individually completed UML.

#### Exit criteria:
A better understanding of project requirements and each others UML’s strength and weaknesses

#### c.	Activity Name:
Group - Requirements Gathering

#### Activity description:
In this phase, we combed through the documents and collected every single explicitly mentioned or implied requirements in the project description document. We also filled every necessary information gap that the document did not cover in order to ensure that we did not level holes by just focusing on the main requirements.

#### Entrance criteria:
Completed initial brainstorming and understanding of the project

#### Exit criteria:
Full and actionable set of requirements to be met by the app

#### d.	Activity Name:
Group - Analysis and Design

#### Activity description:
Here we used the information we collected through our requirements gathering, analyzed the information and our individuals UML to come with the best architecture. We analyzed and updated the design iteratively to hone in on the optimal UML which we submitted as the team UML. Besides designing the actual app, we have also laid out the test cases we will be using to ensure we have a plan on how we will be testing our system.

#### Entrance criteria:
Project description and gathered requirements from last step

#### Exit criteria:
An optimal system architecture (UML) that we are confident in as a team and test cases we plan on using when we eventually have developed the actual app.

#### e. Activity Name:
Group - Implementation

#### Activity description:
We have not started this phase yet but we will be beginning the coding aspect soon. In essence we will convert our UML into a code that will then become this android word game app.

#### Entrance criteria:
Completed analysis and design that lays the groundwork for our code.

#### Exit criteria:
A completed code that seeks to implement everything we have outlined - however it is still not fully tested.

#### f.Activity Name:
Group - Testing

#### Activity description:
In this phase we will be using the test cases we created to debug our code and ensure we have eliminated bugs in the system.

#### Entrance criteria:
Completed initial code and test cases

#### Exit criteria:
Robust and bug-free code

#### g.	Activity Name:
Group - Deployment

#### Activity description:
We will finally deploy the app either to an emulator or to android store so we can test and run it on an android phone

#### Entrance criteria:
Bug free (tested) code

#### Exit criteria:
Verify that app runs smoothly and error-free on the phone or emulator
