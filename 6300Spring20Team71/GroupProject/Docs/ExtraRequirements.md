#  Extra Requirements


One main thing that we need to ensure is that no significant latency should be observed in use of this word game. Even a bug free game would be unplayable should it lag a lot and thus leading to a negative user experience.

Aside from the above point, we did not come across any requirements that we have not covered already. However for a product to be truly useful, it needs to be able to function under all the variabilities of the real world. Thus some of the Extra Requirements that we need to be cognizant of but might not necessarily need to act upon in this project are:
1. Flexibility to work across different platforms
2. Robustness to handle different screen sizes
3. Language and hence gameplay adjustment
4. Over air updates
5. Network gaming
6. Scalable based on available system resource
